# PromptPath

**PromptPath** helps developers understand *how* AI coding tools actually help them — and whether they’re learning or just moving faster.

> **PromptPath is intentionally manual-first.**  
> The act of logging forces reflection, which is where the learning happens.  
> Automation comes later, but insight comes from intent.

## 🚀 What Problem Does This Solve?
AI tools like Cursor, Claude Code, and Copilot make developers faster — but speed alone doesn’t equal growth.

Most tools optimize for:
- More completions
- Faster output
- Less friction

**PromptPath optimizes for understanding.**

It answers questions like:
- When does AI *actually* save me time?
- What kinds of tasks does it help most?
- Am I learning — or blindly accepting answers?

---

## 🧠 Core Idea
Instead of auto-tracking everything, PromptPath asks users to **log AI coding sessions in under 60 seconds**.

That short pause enables:
- Reflection
- Higher-quality insights
- Better long-term habits

The goal isn’t perfect data — it’s *meaningful signals*.

## ✨ MVP Features

### 1. Manual Session Logging (Fast & Lightweight)
Log an AI coding session with:
- Tool used (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot, etc.)
- Task type (debugging, refactor, architecture, etc.)
- Outcome (worked / partially / didn’t)
- Accept mode (as-is / modified / reference)
- Estimated time saved
- What you learned

⏱️ Designed to take **45–60 seconds**.

---

### 2. Insight-Driven Dashboard
At a glance, users can see:
- Average time saved per session
- Sessions logged this week
- Learning density (sessions with reflections)
- Accept vs modify ratio

Plus a task effectiveness breakdown showing **where AI helps most — and least**.

---

### 3. Weekly AI Summary
Each week, PromptPath generates a short, editable summary highlighting:
- Best-performing task types
- Weak or risky areas
- Learning trends
- One actionable recommendation

Users can edit the summary to keep it honest and personal.

---

## 🧭 Why Manual-First?
Most productivity tools try to remove friction. PromptPath **adds a small, intentional pause**.

That pause:
- Encourages validation instead of blind acceptance
- Turns AI usage into learning moments
- Produces higher-quality insights than raw telemetry

Automation is a future enhancement — **reflection is the product**.

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack (MVP)
- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charts:** Recharts / Chart.js
- **Backend:** Supabase (Auth + Database)
- **AI:** OpenAI or Claude (weekly summaries only)

Most insights are computed deterministically; AI is used selectively and intentionally.

---

## 📦 MVP Scope (What This Is — and Isn’t)

### Included
- Manual session logging
- Insight dashboard
- Weekly summaries
- Personal analytics

### Not Included (Yet)
- Cursor API integrations
- Automatic prompt capture
- Team analytics
- Prompt clustering

These are intentionally deferred to protect focus and trust.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria
The MVP is successful if:
- Users log multiple sessions per week
- Weekly summaries feel accurate and useful
- Users can clearly answer: *“Where does AI help me most?”*

---

## 🧠 Project Motivation
PromptPath was built to explore:
- Responsible AI usage
- Reflection-driven productivity
- Turning subjective inputs into actionable insights

It’s not about using AI more — it’s about using it **better**.

---

## 🔮 Future Ideas
- Browser extension for assisted logging
- Prompt libraries and pattern analysis
- Team-level (opt-in) insights
- Deeper learning trend analysis
